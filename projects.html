        >Presented below is a selection of projects I worked on both during my
        employment and in my free time. <br />
        I was the sole developer for each of them, responsible for both the
        frontend and backend.

        <h2 class="keyword no-underline">Price Tag & Poster Generator</h2>
        <span class="text-sm"
          >A tool for generating price tags and price posters used across the
          entire store chain. It's based on HTML templates that are populated
          with input data about products and then processed into PDFs. For me
          the crucial aspect was for the program to be dynamic and as generic as
          possible, relying mostly on input data in order to generate proper
          output so that when faced with new requirements, it is only a matter
          of creating a new HTML template as the need for modifying the code is
          diminished to minimum.</span

          Music Collaboration Platform (in progress)
        </h2>
        <span class="text-sm"
          >A web application tailored for my needs when collaborating with
          artists on new music and meant to facilitate exchange of ideas and
          providing feedback. I started off with Strapi CMS for the backend and
          went with Next 14 as the front layer. Unfortunately, Strapi had
          quickly proven to be cumbersome and hard to adjust and maintain (e.g.
          limited TypeScript support) as the required functionalities were
          growing more complex. Thus, I had decided to rewrite the backend in
          Django. Moving to another technology created some time overhead as I
          had to learn a new environment and implement things such as JWT
          authentication myself. Some core features of the app include user
          accounts, role-based access, app-wide audio player, conversations,
          mobile-first approach and exclusive access to content. In the future,
          I am planning to enhance the UX with real time notifications, chat and
          integration of online payments.</span

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
        <h2 class="keyword no-underline">Loss Management App</h2>
        <span class="text-sm"
          >An application that helps managing and limiting losses generated by
          retail stores by providing a platform for managers to keep track of
          visits made to their stores and to fill out surveys regarding the most
          important aspects of conducting sales. This project helped me to
          understand how to build a more complex frontend with different pages
          sharing state and how to process data more efficiently to reduce
          render times. It also required from me to design the backend in a way
          that ensures consistency and integrity while avoiding hard-coding to
          make sure some components of the application could be altered without
          affecting the code.</span

      <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
        <h2 class="keyword no-underline">Ticket Management Utility</h2>
        <span class="text-sm"
          >My first hobby project aimed at speeding up some tedious cyclic tasks
          that needed to be done when I was working at IT support. That process
          involved downloading a report from an internal servicedesk and then
          manually copying and pasting certain records into separate excel
          files. What I did was semi-automation of the entire process by
          integrating with an API to obtain data from the SD platform and
          providing an elegant UI that allowed much faster data entry with the
          possibility of quickly exporting new, aggregated data to Excel format.
          The tool eventually ended up used by my entire team and was my gateway
          to landing a developer position.</span
